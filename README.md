# Project Description: O(n) algorithm for the k largest elements

Implement the expected O(n) algorithm for the k largest elements (select) of an array, and compare its performance with the algorithm using priority queues that we designed for the same problem on streams.

Use k=n/2 (median), and try large values of n: 16M, 32M, 64M, 128M, 256M.
